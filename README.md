# Vim Settings

My personal settings for vim8 (plugins & more)

## Install from scratch

1. Clone the `repo` and create alias  the `dot.vimrc` and `dot.vim` in `~/` as `.vim` and `.vimrc`

2. `cd` in `~/.vim/pack` and execute `./install.sh` to automaticaly install all the plugins mentioned inside `install.sh`.

That's it
